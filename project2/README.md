to run preprocessing, run pre-process.py and/or pre-process-alt.py with one of the following command line arguments:

    mini-movie-review (The small corpus for genres )
    movie-review (Shortened list of positive and negative movie reviews)
    movie-review-hw2 (Full list of positive and negative movie reviews) (VERY LONG)

to classify, run NB.py with
    the same argument as you ran for preprocessing
    OPTIONAL: include -alt as the last argument to predict on pre-process-alt.py

I strongly recommend using movie-review to check the accuracy of the model.
movie-review-hw2 does not run in reasonable time.
